# ADDRESSBOOK_C_PROJECT
Description

The Address Book project in C is a great way to practice file handling, data structures (like arrays or linked lists), and basic algorithms for searching, sorting, and modifying data. It's also a practical example of how simple databases work at a fundamental level. This console-based application allows users to manage a list of contacts efficiently.

Features

1. Add Contact:

The user can input details like name, phone number, email, and address.

The new contact is saved into a file or an array, depending on how the project is structured.

The program checks for duplicate entries to avoid redundant data.

2. View Contacts:

This feature allows the user to view all the contacts stored in the address book.

Contacts are displayed in a formatted list showing details like name, phone number, etc.

Sorting functionality may also be implemented to display contacts alphabetically or by other criteria.

3. Search Contacts:

Users can search for a specific contact by name, phone number, or other criteria.

The program retrieves and displays the matching contact(s) from the address book.

4. Edit Contact:

Enables users to modify the details of an existing contact.

The user selects a contact to edit and then updates the necessary fields.

The modified contact is saved back to the file or array.

5. Delete Contact:

Users can remove a contact from the address book.

The program deletes the selected contact and updates the file or array to reflect the changes.

6. Save and Load Contacts:

Contacts are stored in a file (text or binary) to persist data between sessions.

The program loads the contacts from the file when it starts and saves any changes when the program exits or when requested by the user.

7. User Interface:

The interface is text-based, using menus for different operations (e.g., Add, View, Search, Edit, Delete, Exit).

Error handling is implemented to manage incorrect inputs or operations.

Requirements

GCC compiler

Any standard C library

A terminal to execute the program

Possible Improvements

Enhance user interface with a graphical version

Add support for sorting contacts alphabetically

Implement additional search filters
